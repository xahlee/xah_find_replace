Several general and customizable find/replace scripts similar to sed/awk/grep.

- find.go → golang version
- find.pl → perl version
- find.py3 → python 3, no regex

find/replace scripts:

- replace.go → golang version
- replace_regex.py3  → python 3, with regex

For emacs lisp version intgrated with emacs, see http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp-xah-find-text.html

These are tools for programers.

To use, open the script, and edit the input path, and other parameters such as find/replace string or regex.

These scripts do not use command line args by design, because when the string is long, it's easier to work with the script.

Typically, in emacs or whatever IDE, setup shortcut keys to open these files. Then just edit the script and run it.

Features:

- Multiple find/replace pairs.
- with regex or literal replacement.
- Find and replace strings can be multi-lines.
- Find and replace strings can contain unicode characters.
- work on list of files, or all files in a directory or sub-directory.
- Can specify a range of depth level of a directory.
- Works with Unicode UTF-8 encoded files.
